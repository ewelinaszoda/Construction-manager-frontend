React.js

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Usage and Features

Construction Manager allows users to manage and keep track on projects. Users can:

Sign up and sign in, to keep tract of their projects
Edit personal information
Create the project with an image, decription, location and email's contacts
Create a meeting and note assigned to the project
See current date, calendar, and meetings on the main page
View and search by project's name of all projects
View and search by meeting's name of all meetings
Delete the project

## Instalation

To use Construction Manager locally, you will need Git and Node Package Manager installed. You will also need the backend to be running, which can be found https://github.com/ewelinaszoda/Construction-manager-backend. After this, you will only need to clone this repo and launch the frontend to start following commands:

npm install

npm start

Utilised JSON Web Tokens and localStorage to store encrypted user information client-side
Developed a Rails API backend utilising MCS (model, controller, Serializer) concept and CRUD actions
Engineered user interface employing React with Material-UI for styling 
Improved user experience with responsive/mobile design techniques and validations with client-side error handling

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
